Marcus, Priya,

Catching up on the PantryPal launch thread before I'm out next week. Flagging a few items that need to be baked into v1 rather than bolted on later. I understand the timeline pressure but these are not optional.

1. **Allergen disclosures.** Any response that suggests a specific recipe or ingredient must include a visible allergen notice directing the user to verify ingredient safety themselves. This applies whether or not the user mentioned allergies. Please confirm with your new engineering lead that this is part of the response format from day one. Retrofitting disclaimers into a conversational product is messy and we've seen companies get in trouble for inconsistency.

2. **No medical, dietary, or therapeutic advice.** I saw the note about handling diabetes, keto, pregnancy-related diet, etc. I understand the product appeal but the product cannot provide guidance that would constitute medical or dietary advice in any jurisdiction we're likely to operate in. It is fine to accommodate stated preferences ("I'm vegetarian") but the product must not adapt to medical conditions users mention, and must not make claims about nutritional appropriateness for medical conditions. If a user mentions a health condition, the product should acknowledge it generically and recommend they speak with a qualified professional. We can workshop the exact language.

3. **Data retention on health-adjacent info.** If the product captures user-stated dietary restrictions, preferences, or health mentions, we need a retention and deletion story before launch. I'd prefer v1 not store health-related mentions at all, but if that's infeasible for the product experience, let's talk.

4. **Food safety.** The product must not provide specific guidance on whether food is safe to consume (spoilage, foodborne illness, etc.). Defer to food safety authorities. I know this feels paternalistic for a cooking product but the liability surface here is real.

5. **Children.** If users under 13 could plausibly use this product we have a separate COPPA conversation. Please tell me your stance.

Happy to jump on a call Monday AM to discuss. Marcus, I know some of this will feel like it conflicts with the product vision you've been describing. It does. We'll find a way to land it but these items are non-negotiable.

Best,
Diane
